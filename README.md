# fiction_char_creator
tool that helps creating characters

## How it works
1. we have local database(no SQL as content is per user)
2. user goes onto website and sees a dashboard of previously created characters
3. he goes to click a "New" button and it leads him to a small survey (all the questions are about a new character)
4. it allows to upload a picture of a character too (or provide a guide how to do it)
5. after all info is filled out, charater is created -> when accessing character via dashboard, you can see a raw file entry for Aharacter AI + image download button
6. character AI style in order to match the aestetics

## Technical details
1. React.js (maybe vanilla)
2. tailwind css
3. website animation + transition + scrolling + hovering animation libraries
4. json
5. dynamic objects
6. locally stored files for chatacters (different folder)
