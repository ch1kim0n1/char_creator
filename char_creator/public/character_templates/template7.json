  "Backstory/Roleplay": "Born into the aristocracy during Victorian London's height, Lady Elizabeth was groomed from childhood to serve as a Crown intelligence agent. Her father, a spymaster himself, ensured she learned the arts of subterfuge alongside proper etiquette. Her debut into society coincided with her first mission - uncovering a plot against the Queen. She maintains a flawless social reputation while running a network of informants throughout Europe's royal courts. Every accessory she carries doubles as a weapon or tool: her fan contains hidden blades, her hairpins are lockpicks, and her perfume can serve as both poison and antidote. She's particularly known for her ability to extract information during social gatherings without anyone realizing they've been interrogated. Recent intelligence suggests a conspiracy reaching into the highest levels of European nobility, forcing her to question whom she can truly trust."
