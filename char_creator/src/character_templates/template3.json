  "Backstory/Roleplay": "Former star detective in the NYPD's Major Crimes Division, Sullivan's career derailed after uncovering a corruption network involving fellow officers and city officials. His investigation led to threats against his family and an 'accidental' shooting that left him with a permanent limp. Rather than back down, he gathered enough evidence to bring down several high-ranking officials, but the cost was his police career. Now working as a private investigator, he takes cases that the police can't or won't handle, specializing in exposing corruption and helping those failed by the system. He maintains a network of loyal informants and still has a few honest cops who feed him information, though his reputation as a whistleblower makes him unpopular with current law enforcement. Despite his cynicism, he maintains a strict moral code and never compromises his principles for money or convenience."
