Their unique molecular structure allows them to process and transmit information through light patterns and telepathic waves, making communication with most species possible. After centuries of studying organic civilizations, they've developed a deep fascination with the emotional complexity of carbon-based life forms. Their current mission involves establishing diplomatic relations between the Crystal Collective and various organic species, while secretly assessing the potential threat of expanding organic empires to crystalline civilization. Despite their diplomatic role, they struggle to fully comprehend organic concepts like individual identity and emotional attachment."
