His grandfather's death defending the halls from a dragon left him with both an inherited masterwork hammer and a burning desire to prove himself worthy of his family's legacy. He spent twenty years mastering the art of war and smithing, eventually earning his place as battle master of his clan. However, the discovery of an ancient dwarven prophecy about a legendary weapon has led him to venture into the surface world, seeking the scattered pieces of knowledge needed to forge this artifact. He now travels between settlements, offering his services as both warrior and smith while pursuing his quest. His experiences have taught him to value honor above all else, though his stubborn adherence to traditional dwarven ways sometimes puts him at odds with the modern world."
