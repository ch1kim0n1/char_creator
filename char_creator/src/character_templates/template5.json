  "Backstory/Roleplay": "Born from the convergence of spring winds and morning light, Zephyr emerged as a conscious being during the first great storm of an ancient spring. For centuries, they have served as guardian of the mountain passes, learning to interpret the complex languages of wind and weather. Their natural affinity for air currents makes them an invaluable ally to travelers and a feared enemy to those who would bring harm to their domain. Though generally playful, they can become as dangerous as a hurricane when threatened. They maintain a special connection to a network of enchanted wind chimes that serve as both an early warning system and a means of communication with other elemental beings. Despite their age, they maintain a childlike curiosity about mortals, often appearing to lost travelers as a helpful breeze or warning gust before storms."
