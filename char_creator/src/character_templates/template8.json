  "Backstory/Roleplay": "Last surviving member of the ancient Order of the Silver Dawn, Viktor underwent forbidden rituals to enhance his abilities against supernatural threats. His body bears magical tattoos that grant him resistance to dark magic and the ability to sense monsters. After his order was destroyed by a cult of monster worshippers, he's dedicated his life to hunting dangerous creatures while searching for worthy apprentices to pass on his knowledge. His extensive bestiary contains information about hundreds of monsters, including methods to track, fight, and banish them. The rituals that enhanced him left him sterile and prone to occasional bouts of beast-like rage, but he considers it a fair price for the power to protect humanity from supernatural threats. He maintains a network of contacts in various towns and cities, keeping track of monster migrations and unusual occurrences."
