  "Backstory/Roleplay": "Abandoned at a young age, Zero_Day grew up in the digital underground of Neo-Tokyo's network slums. Their natural talent for coding caught the attention of the legendary hacktivist group 'Ghost Protocol,' who provided them with black market cybernetic enhancements and training. After uncovering evidence of corporate experimentation on orphaned children, they dedicated themselves to exposing corporate crimes and dismantling digital control systems. Their signature move involves leaving a small piece of consciousness in every system they hack, creating a vast network of digital eyes and ears. Despite their young age, they've become a symbol of resistance in the digital underground, known for providing safe passage through corporate networks to those fleeing digital persecution."
