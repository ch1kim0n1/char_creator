  "Backstory/Roleplay": "Born from the first ray of sunlight that pierced creation's darkness, Amara embodies the sun's life-giving power and protective fury. She maintains the delicate balance between light and shadow, ensuring neither overwhelms the world. Though immortal and immensely powerful, she chooses to interact with mortals through avatars, teaching them the importance of inner light and personal growth. Her greatest trial came during the Eternal Eclipse, where she sacrificed a portion of her power to prevent darkness from consuming the world. This sacrifice left her changed, more understanding of mortal struggles and the importance of balance. She now leads the Order of Dawn, a group of chosen mortals who help maintain the balance between light and dark, while preparing for a prophesied final confrontation with Void, her shadow-bound sibling."
